# Wikipedia plugin for Minecraft servers

This plugin is written with the Bukkit API and adds a command in the game that will return a short summary of the wikipedia article of a search word or phrase. The [REST API v1 from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/) is used for the requests.
